//! CDP Sandbox - Experimental and development area
//!
//! This crate is for experimental code and prototypes.
//! Once code is validated via oracle testing, it should be moved
//! to its appropriate module crate (cdp-housekeep, cdp-modify, etc.)
//!
//! Current experiments:
//! - Phase vocoder implementation
//! - Spectral processing algorithms

pub mod experiments;

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn sandbox_test() {
        // Placeholder test
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
