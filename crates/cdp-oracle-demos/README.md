# CDP Oracle Demos (Internal Testing)

This crate contains internal demonstrations of the oracle testing system. 

**⚠️ This is NOT for end users** - these are internal tools for validating our Rust implementations against CDP binaries.

## Purpose

- Demonstrates how oracle testing validates Rust implementations
- Used internally by developers to verify byte-perfect compatibility
- Not part of the public API

## For Users

Please see the `/examples` directory at the project root for user-facing examples that demonstrate CDP-RS functionality using the public API.
