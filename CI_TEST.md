# CI Test

This is a test file to trigger CI and validate the build/test process after the recent make command standardization changes.

## Test Status
- Created: 2025-08-24
- Purpose: Verify CI error reporting and build compatibility
- Issue: #20

## Expected Results
The CI should run successfully through these key stages:
1. Lint check (cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy)
2. Build (make install-cdp, make)  
3. Test execution
4. Oracle validation tests
5. Coverage and benchmarks

If any step fails, we should see clear error messages and artifacts uploaded for debugging.
